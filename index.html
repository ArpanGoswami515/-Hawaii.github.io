        <h1>Introduction of Hawaii</h1>
        <p>Hawaii is a unique archipelago (island chain) formed from a geologic 'hot spot' (see next section on Geology for details). It will always be changing over millions of years. Hawaii arises from the deep ocean floor of the North Pacific Ocean, right in the middle of the Pacific tectonic plate. Because of this, its mountain peaks are the highest on Earth - a total of close to 32,000 feet from bottom to top (rising from 18,000 feet below the surface of the ocean to about 14,000 feet above sea level). The Hawaiian island chain is composed of volcanoes in all stages - active erupting ones (sometimes making new acreage), dormant ones eroding away, and dead ones that may have subsided below the ocean. Hawaii is one of the most isolated of the islands on Earth - being over 3,000 miles from the closest continental land mass and 2,000 miles from the nearest island.</p>

        <h1>Things to know:-</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Lei etiquette:-</h3>
                <p>When you arrive and/or leave, you may be given a lei. This is a gesture of aloha (love, affection, esteem); thus, you should always graciously accept it and the hug or kiss on the cheek that comes with it. Closed (tied) lei should rest on the shoulders, half draped in the front and half down the back. Open (untied) lei are worn around the neck, with each side hanging evenly down the front. Pregnant women should wear only open lei; closed lei are considered bad luck because they symbolize the umbilical cord around the baby’s neck.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Hawaiian or Local:-</h3>
                <p>People from around the world started immigrating to Hawaii in the mid-1800s to work on sugar plantations. After fulfilling their contracts, the majority of them stayed, creating Hawaii’s wonderful melting pot. There’s a distinction between “Hawaiians” and “locals.” Hawaiians claim native ancestry; locals are Hawaii residents who may not have Hawaiian blood. Kama`aina refers to longtime Hawaii residents; malihini means newcomers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Leave your slippers at the door:-</h3>
                <p>You’ll notice that people remove their footwear before entering a house, a practice traced to Japanese immigrants. Homes in Japan are typically built a few feet above the cold, damp earth. People remove their shoes at the ground level and step up into the house in their socks, so dirt and germs are not brought inside. Removing footwear also indicates they are entering the house with “clean” thoughts and spirits. </p>
